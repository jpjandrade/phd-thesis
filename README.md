# Statistical Mechanics of Economic Systems

This repository contains my thesis on Statistical Mechanics of Economic Systems, submitted to the University of São Paulo in 2016 as part of the PhD program in Physics. It contains no code or material of the actual work presented there (some of the material is available in other repositories), only the .tex file itself.

The main .tex file is main.tex, which includes all other files. The template used was found available on [ShareLaTeX](http://www.sharelatex.com) and is a modified version of the classicthesis template made by [André Miede](http://www.miede.de/).
